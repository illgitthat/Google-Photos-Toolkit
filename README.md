## How It Works

In your browser, utilizing GP's undocumented web api

## How To Install

### Finding space-consuming media

This example groups all space-consuming media in one album.

1. Make sure "Library" is the selected source
2. Select `SPACE-CONSUMING` in the `Space` filter
3. Select action `Add to new album`

### Identify media not in any albums

Select all albums in the `Exclude albums` filter, then use appropriate action.

### Identifying duplicates/similar images

Use `Similarity` filter with action `Add to new album`
Media with similar thumbnails will be added to the album.

### Deleting all media in the library

As simple as selecting "Library" source, clicking `Move to trash`, then clearing it.

### Use GPTK's api

GPTK exports it's api class globally so you can use it in your browser's console.
It's much more powerful than the UI!

Example usage.
Scan the whole library for media owned by `ownerName` and move it to trash if found.

```js
let nextPageId = null;
const ownerName = "John";
do {
  const page = await gptkApi.getItemsByUploadedDate(nextPageId);
  for (const item of page.items) {
    if (item.isOwned) continue;
    const itemInfo = await gptkApi.getItemInfoExt(item.mediaKey);
    console.log(`${item.mediaKey} is shared by ${itemInfo.owner.name}`);
    if (itemInfo.owner.name == ownerName) {
      await gptkApi.moveItemsToTrash([itemInfo.dedupKey]);
      console.log(`${item.mediaKey} moved to trash`);
    }
  }
  nextPageId = page.nextPageId;
} while (nextPageId);
console.log("DONE");
```

I just found this post, after doing all the work from zero :D

Also, i've made a userscript that parses all responses and logs them to console in a more readable way, you can find it here - [https://github.com/xob0t/Google-Photos-Toolkit/tree/main/tools](https://github.com/xob0t/Google-Photos-Toolkit/tree/main/tools)
